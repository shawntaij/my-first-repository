        <p>Hello everyone! ☺ <p>
        </p> My name is Shawntai and I was born in Toronto, Canada. I’ve lived my life going back and forth from Toronto to Miami! I am a Customer Service Representative (9 years of experience) who wants to pursue her dream of working in the tech field. I’ve already gained the skills to become a UX Designer, however, I want to add more under my belt by learning Web Development.</p>
